# Rust-ified Micrograd

My attempt at a Rust version of https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd I coded following along [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) _great_ video. I highly recommend it - and it's part of a larger [series](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) by Karpathy on neural nets.

Fair warning: I'm re-learning Rust as I tinker with this so I wouldn't necessarily call this "good Rust" :)
